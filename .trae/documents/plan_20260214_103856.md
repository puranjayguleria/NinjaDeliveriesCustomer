This error (`java.lang.NullPointerException ... DevServerHelper`) is a common **environment connectivity issue** in React Native, usually caused when the app loses connection to the Metro bundler during a "Fast Refresh" or reload. It is **not** caused by a syntax error in the code we just wrote.

### **Step 1: Fix the Crash**
1.  **Close the app** on your device/emulator.
2.  **Restart your Metro Bundler** (the terminal running the React Native server).
    *   Press `r` to reload if it's running, or stop it and run `npx react-native start --reset-cache`.
3.  **Re-open the app**.

### **Step 2: Firestore Configuration (Answering your question)**
Yes, you **must** add the new field to your Firestore for the backgrounds to appear.

**Collection**: `shivratri_config`
**Document**: `settings`

Update the document to include:
*   `isVisible`: `true` (Controls the Banner & Shortcuts)
*   `isBackgroundVisible`: `true` (Controls the Background Images)

If `isBackgroundVisible` is missing, it will default to `false` (no background).
