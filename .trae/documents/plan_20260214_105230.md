The pink color behind the search bar is controlled by the `headerGradientColors` field in your Firestore.

**Collection**: `config`
**Document**: The document ID matches your current `storeId` (e.g., `0oS7Zig2gxj2MJesvlC2` or similar).

**Field**: `headerGradientColors` (Array of strings)
**Current Fallback/Value**: `["#FF5FA2", "#FFD1E6", "#FFFFFF"]` (This is the pink gradient you are seeing).

If you want to change it, find the document in the `config` collection that corresponds to your store and update the `headerGradientColors` array with your desired hex codes.
